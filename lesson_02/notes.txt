CSS is a language used to style websites. 
Colors, fonts, and page layouts for a site 
can all be managed using CSS. The more comfortable 
you are with CSS, the better equipped you will be to create stylish 
and contemporary-looking websites.

We use a link element to reference a CSS file. A CSS file contains all of our style attributes


CSS files are made up of CSS rules.
A rule consists of a selector h1 {} a propertery h1{color:}, and a value h1{color:red;}
Font family are the font types you will be using. 
If a browser is unable to support one, it uses the next on the list

You can use CSS to select an element by its class as well.
.hero{

}

or by its id 

#hero{
    
}

pixel (px): Standard unit of measurement for sizing fonts and other HTML elements.


rem: Represents the default font size for the web browser. 
Rems can be used to ensure that HTML elements scale in proportion to 
each other on various web browsers and screen sizes. 
On most web browsers, 1rem is equivalent to 16px, 2rem is equivalent to 32px (a doubling), 
3rem is equivalent to 48px (a tripling) and so on.


em: A relative value that changes in proportion to the font-size of the element on which em is used. 
Because font-size is an inherited property, this usually means the em value will change in proportion 
to the font-size of the parent element unless a font-size is explicitly set on the element 
on which em is used. For example, if a parent element has font-size: 20px;, 
child elements with font-size: 1em; would be equivalent to 20px. 
Child elements with font-size: 0.5em; would be equivalent to 10px (a halving) and so on.

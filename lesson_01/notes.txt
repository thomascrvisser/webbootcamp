Welcome to our first lesson!

The bulk of our webpage will be in index.html
We are writing in HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language)

Websites are built with building blocks - these are html elements
An element consists of an opening tag <> and a closing tag </> there are many different types of tags but not all of them require closing tags
Some basics:
        <h1></h1>
        <p></p>
        <head></head>
        <body></body>

They all do something different to the text that's inside of them. You can wrap elements within each other.
In that case the outer element is referred to as the parent and the elements inside are the children

<!DOCTYPE html>: Tells the web browser to expect an HTML document.


<html>...</html>: The root of the HTML document and parent of all other HTML elements on the webpage.


<head>...</head>: Enclose other metadata about the site, such as its title.


<title>...</title>: Contains the site’s title, which is one way users can find your site through a search engine, like Google.

<meta charset="utf-8"/>: Tells the web browser which character set to use. In this case, the character set is “utf-8”.



What if we wanted to attach a link to different page?
Anchors!
<a></a>

Anchors are made up of a few different parts: <a href="http://www.youtube.com">Link Text</a>
                                                 att name - att val - link text       


Lets add some pictures!
We use the image element
<img src=""</> this is one of those without a closing tag
the source can be a url, or better yet, the path on your computer to where you can find it.

videos are also cool
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="video-url.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>



div's are the main way to keep your website organized. 
They're really important when it comes to moving and styling your website

divs and elements can be give class names(for divs) or ids(for specific items)

This helps when we get into CSS
